# Dataset-of-Movie-Preferences-and-Personality-Profiles
This dataset aims to identify any correlations among movie marketing strategies, movie-watching intention, movie preferences, and respondents' personality traits. Ideally, these insights could contribute to psychotherapy research or simply offer interesting findings about personality.
## Data Collection
The data was collected and managed by Shufan Chai via a Tencent Form. There were no age or location restrictions for respondents. From early August to late September 2021, the form was posted on several social media platforms, including WeChat and Weibo, with responses collected directly through Tencent Form's backend. Additionally, Shufan Chai joined film-related groups to reach more respondents, aiming to make the survey results more representative and reliable.
## About the form
The form consists of three parts:
1. Simulated Scenarios
2. Big Five Personality Test
3. Respondents' Basic Information
