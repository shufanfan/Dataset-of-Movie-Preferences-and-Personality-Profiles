# Dataset-of-Movie-Preferences-and-Personality-Profiles
This dataset aims to identify any correlations among movie marketing strategies, movie-watching intention, movie preferences, and respondents' personality traits. Ideally, these insights could contribute to psychotherapy research or simply offer interesting findings about personality.
## Data Collection
The data was collected and managed by Shufan Chai via a Tencent Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location. From early August to late September 2021, the form was posted on several social media platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo. Responses were collected directly through Tencent Form's backend. Additionally, Shufan Chai joined some film-related WeChat groups to reach more respondents, aiming to make the survey results more representative and reliable.
